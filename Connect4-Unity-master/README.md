Connect 4 AI Game with Multi-Level Difficulty using Alpha-Beta Pruning

Overview

This project is a modern, AI-powered version of the classic Connect 4 game. It features multiple difficulty levels powered by the Alpha-Beta Pruning optimization of the Minimax algorithm, providing a challenging and competitive experience for players of all skill levels. The game is built in Unity using C#, offering a polished user interface and fluid gameplay.

Features

Three difficulty levels:

Easy: Shallow or random move selection for casual play.

Medium: Moderate-depth search for balanced competition.

Hard: Deep Alpha-Beta search for near-optimal, challenging gameplay.

Interactive, visually appealing game board with smooth animations.

Efficient AI decision-making through Alpha-Beta Pruning for faster responses.

Modular code structure for easy future enhancements and maintenance.

Game Rules

Two players take turns dropping discs into a vertical grid.

The first player to connect four discs in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.

If the board fills up without a winner, the game is a draw.

Project Structure

AI Logic: Minimax with Alpha-Beta Pruning for efficient decision making.

UI and Animations: Developed using Unityâ€™s powerful 2D tools.

Game State Management: Decoupled for flexibility and maintainability.
